      <p >As about all a panda does all day is to eat and sleep, you are best to get up early for a visit to a panda park, so you see them when they are active.
They spend as long as 14 hours eating per day, and spend the rest of their time in sleeping. 
In the wild, the giant pandas sleep for 2 to 4 hours between its two meals. </p>
